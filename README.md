# What It Does
This Python3 file will create a list of all the stock on the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and DOW and randomly select one. Then, it will randomly select a "call" or "put" option as well as a date to purchase.

Example output:
```
python3 .\wsb_random.py
Ticker: SLG
February 19, 2021: $114.5 Call, literally can't go tits up
--- 9.462522029876709 seconds ---

# Prerequisites
Uses the Yahoo_fin module. Follow instructions here to install http://theautomatic.net/yahoo_fin-documentation/. DISCLAIMER: Did not create this, I only used the API.

# Purpose and Future Steps
I created this because I had gotten interested in the culture at reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets and this was something that would def fit in there. I also wanted a simple project to start off what I can do.
